# How to create an R package :package:

Check out the [slidedeck](https://isteves.github.io/r-pkg-intro/Presentation.html#/) to quickly build your first package! :palm_tree: :sunny: :ocean:

Also check out these guides to package development in R:

- [Writing an R package from scratch](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) blogpost by Hilary Parker
- [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) book by Hadley Wickham

Here are some other great **packages** you may want to check out:

- [usethis](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis) 
- [goodpractice](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/goodpractice) 
- [styler](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) for auto-style checking
- [lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) for style - use with Travis to auto-check your code!
- [pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown) for creating a website for your package

And some **keyboard short-cuts**:

- *Cmd + i* = auto-indent
- *Cmd + opt + shift + r* = auto-generate roxygen skeleton
- *Cmd + shift + t* = `devtools::test()`
- *Cmd + shift + d* = `devtools::document()`
