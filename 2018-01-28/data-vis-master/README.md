# data-vis
This repository has the code and data files necessary for the 'Data Visualization - Introduction to ggplot' workshop on January 17, 2018 at UCSB. The objective is to introduce basics of creating and customizing graph using ggplot, including:

- General structure of ggplot() code
- Customizing axes labels and titles
- Customizing graph aesthetics (by variable)
- Faceting (facet_wrap)
- Types of graphs (geoms)
- Bar graphs (stacked counts, proportions, and clustered)
- Exporting graphs (ggsave)

Before the workshop, please:

- Install the tidyverse package if you don't have it already (ggplot2 package is included in the tidyverse)
- Load the dataset np_visit.csv (a file containing visitor counts at National Parks in the United States)
